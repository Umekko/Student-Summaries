# Student-Summaries
Evaluate Student Summaries


The goal of this competition is to assess the quality of summaries written by students in grades 3-12
I have built a model that evaluates how well a student represents the main idea and details of a source text, as well as the clarity, precision, and fluency of the language used in the summary. 

As a result, this model will help to develop summary scoring algorithms, teachers and students alike will gain a valuable tool that promotes this fundamental skill. 
Students will have more opportunities to practice summarization, while simultaneously improving their reading comprehension, critical thinking, and writing abilities.
